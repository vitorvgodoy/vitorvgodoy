A full-stack software developer with experience in PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and frameworks like CakePHP and Laravel.

I also have experience in creating and consuming APIs. I studied Systems Analysis and Development at UNIP and am ready to contribute to new projects and provide efficient solutions.
